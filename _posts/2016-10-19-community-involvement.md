<h1>I recently attended a SILS sponsored talk given by Cameron Neylon, called "How Understanding the Cultures of Research Might Move Us Beyond Carrots and Sticks."</h1>
Neylon talked a lot about investing in scholarly futures, and how that relates to the culture of research. One of the points he made was that technology has changed the way scholarly works are distributed. 
Publishing companies are obviously against open access to scholarly journals and research papaers, since they profit from them. However, Neylon argued for creating publics that would benefit from accessible information.
Publishing companies obviously have a lot of power in the industry, and are reluctant to change how things are done. 

One of Neylon's major points is that knowledge is a public good. Public goods are neither _rivalrous_ nor _excludable_. Rivalrous goods are goods that cannot be shared; once you give it to someone else you no longer have it. Non-excludable means that all people can benefit from the good, even if they don't contribute anything. 
Other public goods are resourced and funded at the governmental level. In order to encourage the creation and share of knowledge, Neylon argues that knowledge should be provided with taxpayer funded infrastructure and taxpayer funded research.
Changing the way we view knowledge changes the culture of research. 

Neylon said that technology helps effectively share knowledge as a resource and public good, which helps shape culture. Although I found the lecture a little difficult to follow, I feel like I grasped Neylon's major points. Technology is changing the way that scholarly works are being published, and the publishing industry and scholarly community have to decide whether or not to invest in these technologies and allow open access.
