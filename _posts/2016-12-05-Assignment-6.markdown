# Assignment 6 Reflection
Here is the link to our presentation!
[Our Presentation!](https://emmacai.github.io/emmaandsarah)

I am so proud of of final presentation! This project truly showed how much we learned in this class. 

# Who Did What
Sarah and I collaborated really well on this project. I made the initial repository on Github, cloned the base repository, and changed the remote url of the repository to point to the new repository (making the presentation accessible through my github site). Sarah took charge of formatting the presentation slides in a markdown file. We split the actual research, and combined our notes using a google doc to keep track of our research. We wrote the speaker notes together in class, and Sarah entered them into our markdown file so that we wouldn't have a merge conflict. I embedded the pictures and video. We recorded the audio together (twice, but I'll expand on that later) and I uploaded the audio files into Cloud9 and entered them into the appropriate area in the index.html file. Finally, we edited the style of the presentation together in class. 

# The Process
Sarah and I decided to do our presentation on 3D printing because we were planning on going to a 3D printing workshop for our second community engagment activity. After the workshop, we decided to research prosthetics within 3D printing. We found a lot of information online about 3d printed prosthetics and an interesting video. We split the work evenly and created our presentation mostly in class, with the exception of a few hours spent outside of class.

# Lightbulbs!
Sarah and I had a _lot_ of lightbulb moments in this project. Every time we figured something out we considered it a celebratory milestone. We had a slight issue with our audio not working correctly, but we quickly realized that within the index.html file we had to change the audio file type from .ogg to .mp3, since that is the file type we used. We were so excited to solve this problem on our own! We definitely made use of google in this project, but we were proud to solve problems on our own and not always have to ask Elliot questions. Another major lightbulb was when we discovered that we could edit the html within index.html instead of going back and changing the markdown file. When we edited the markdown file, it erased the changes we would make in index.html, so when we discovered that we could just change the html it was a major lightbulb moment!

# Challenges
One of the major challenges we encountered with this project was capturing our audio. Unforunately, the UNC residence hall network wouldn't let us download Audacity, so we had to play around with Garage Band. We recorded our audio and successfully entered it into our presentation, but when we listened to it, the audio was incredibly poor quality. We decided to re-record our audio using a microphone connected to my laptop. Although tedious and time consuming, the sound quality of our presentation is _much_ better now. 

Another problem I fixed on my own. I found a video clip we wanted to insert, but we needed to have it auto-play so that it wouldn't disrupt the flow of the slides. I followed Elliot's instructions on the class website that guided me through the stepts to convert the youtube video into a .mp4 file. Although it wasn't particularly hard to do, I was proud of myself for doing it on my own!

# How we used skills from this class
This final project was basically a culmination of all of the skills we used in this class. We used markdown and html to edit the basic content of our presentation, and we used pandoc to convert the markdown to html. As I said earlier, our willingness to google was a helpful attitude to have with this project (and coding in general, I think). Finally, something I noticed with this project in particular is how far I've come with just basic github and Cloud9 skills over the course of the semester. I remember the first coupld of weeks of class I never thought I would remember how to push and pull from github or even just cd into a different directory. All of that is habitual now, which is impressive since it's only been a few months. 

# Looking Towards The Future
My problem solving skills (and attitude) that I gained from this class will definitely come in handy as I continue my career at UNC, and in the real world. I plan to take more SILS classes at UNC, so I hope that I will continue to learn more about Github and Cloud9. 

# Final Thoughts
I came into this class not thinking I was going to like it very much. However, at the end of the semester I feel as though I can confidently say this was one of the best classes I've taken thus far at UNC. I have learned so much over the course of a few short months, and I feel as though the skills I've learned are applicable to real life. This class has made me excited to continue to take SILS classes at UNC, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge within the field.
