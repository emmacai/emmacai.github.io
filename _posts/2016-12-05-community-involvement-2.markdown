# Community Event: 3d Printing Workshop
I recently attented a workshop about 3d printing in preparation for my final project, which is about 3d printing prosthetics. The event was held in the Kenan Science Library, which is in the bottom of Venable Hall. I had never been in the Kenan Library before, but it was a very cool space!

At the presentation I learned that 3d printing and 3d scanning are not interchangable terms. 3d scanning is when you have a 3d model that you scan, and the computer makes a printable copy of the object (usually converting the scan into an .stl file) which the printer can then print! 3d printing is when you make an .stl file on the computer and then send the file to the printer, which it uses to create the print. 

I also learned that most printers use plastic for prints, since it is the cheapest and most common. At UNC, students only have access to the printers that use plastic, while the printer that uses metal is usually reserved for specific research purposes. 

After discussing the basics of 3d printing, we talked about designing .stl files on the computer. The Kenan Science Library allows students to print up to 300g a month. However, students aren't allowed to use the printers in the library, you submit .stl files on the library website and pick up your print when it's done. Before we explored the websites that help create .stl files, we discussed design considerations like heft (the product can't be too light or it won't successfully print) and material characteristics. 

Finally, we explored some 3d design programs, particularly [Tinkercad](tinkercad.com). I looked through the gallery of designs, which are really impressive, and then signed up and played around with making my own .stl file. Although I didn't make anything concrete in Tinkercad, I now know how to make the appropriate file type if I want to submit something to be printed!

After the presentation, we went into the room that has the actual 3d printers and watched as one of the machines was printing something. Below is a picture I took of the printer in action. In addition to the actual printers, there were several samples of things that had been 3d printed. My favorite was a (to scale) replica of the Old Well! I was a litte dissapointed that we didn't get to actually 3d print anything, but I now have the resources to do so!
