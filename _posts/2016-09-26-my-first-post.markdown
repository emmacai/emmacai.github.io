<h1>Welcome to my first post for INLS 161!</h1>

Thus far in this class I have learned so much about things I had never heard of before. A lot of the information has been very overwhelming, as we've covered a lot of material in a short amount of time. However, I feel as though I'm learning skills that can be applied to real life situations.

Github and Cloud 9 are two extremely useful sites for coding that I feel relatively comfortable using now (at a very basic level).
I am very comfortable with the basic navigational terms, such as __cd__ and __pwd__, which allow you to change directories and tells you where you are, respectively. 
This git cheat sheet (<a href="">https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</a>) has proven to be very helpful for specific github commands.


To create this post, I added a file in the `_posts` directory. I was able to see what my post would look like on my website by running `jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT`. After I was satisfied with how my post looked, I committed it and push it to github. 

I find html and css to be confusing, but I'm definitely learning and working on improving my understanding.

(This meme is a pretty accurate representation of how I feel in this class.)
